> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This theme *requires* [`card-mod`](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) to render correctly. Without it, blur effects and styling will not work.

> üí° **Optional:** To match the navigation bar shown in screenshots, install the [lovelace-navbar-card](https://github.com/joseluis9595/lovelace-navbar-card).

## üß© Known Issues & Limitations

> These are known limitations caused by platform constraints, aggressive CSS behavior in certain custom cards, or performance trade-offs. Workarounds may be possible in some cases via `card-mod`.


### 1. **Hue-Like Light Card Text Visibility**  
ü™î [#5](https://github.com/wessamlauf/homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes/issues/5)  
When the light is **on**, text inside the `custom:hue-like-light-card` may turn black and become unreadable against the card background.  
This card aggressively reapplies internal styles that override theme-level colors, even with `!important` declarations.  
‚û°Ô∏è *Currently not fixable from the theme side.*


### 2. **State-Based card-mod Styling Fails**  
üé® [#17](https://github.com/wessamlauf/homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes/issues/17)  
Dynamic background colors using Jinja templates in `card_mod` (e.g., for chips) are overridden by the theme‚Äôs global transparency rules (`background: none !important`).  
‚û°Ô∏è *Workaround: Disable Frosted Glass manually per card using `card-mod`.*


### 3. **HACS Dropdowns Broken by Blur**  
üì¶ [#42](https://github.com/wessamlauf/homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes/issues/42)  
Blur effects break dropdown visibility inside HACS menus due to how Home Assistant renders these elements **outside the theme root DOM**.  
Multiple fixes were tested, but the problem stems from **Material Web Components** and is unlikely to be solvable from the theme side.  
‚û°Ô∏è *Won‚Äôt fix unless upstream behavior changes.*


### 4. **stack-in-card Incompatibility**  
üß± [#44](https://github.com/wessamlauf/homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes/issues/44)  
Cards rendered inside `custom:stack-in-card` are deeply nested, and the theme‚Äôs `::before` blur cannot be excluded reliably for inner elements.  
‚û°Ô∏è *Recommended workaround: Use `card-mod` inside each card to manually disable the `::before` layer.*


### 5. **Performance on Low-End Devices**  
The heavy use of `backdrop-filter: blur()` may cause noticeable lag on low-end hardware (older tablets, Pi-based dashboards, etc.).  
‚û°Ô∏è *A future ‚ÄúFrosted Glass Lite‚Äù variant is planned, with simplified visuals for better performance.*
